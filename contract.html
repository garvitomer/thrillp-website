              A contract gives players the ability to make trades on their
              opinions about an event. Each contract has two options 'Yes' and
              'No'. After expiry every event will settle to either 'Yes' or
              'No'. You will get &#8377; 1 for every correctly answered contract
              and &#8377; 0 for wrong one. Note: In case, an event get cancelled
              it will be settled at &#8377; 0.5

              Sure. Let's say you think India GDP will be more than 8% for
              2022-23 and you bought 200 'Yes' contract @ &#8377; 0.4. i.e.
              Total value of &#8377; 80. If actual GDP comes greater than 8%,
              then this contract will be settled at 'Yes'. As you had 200 bought
              'Yes' contract you will get &#8377; 1 for each contract i.e.
              &#8377; 200. And your gross profit in this trade will be &#8377;
              (200 - 80) = &#8377; 120.

            <p>
              I have bought one contract of "Yes" and "No", why I have no
              position?
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Each contract has two option either "Yes" or "No". So, if you buy
              both then effectively, you have no position. You can calculate
              your profit as &#8377; (1-"Yes" buy price + "No" buy price).
